##  Objective:
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify patterns such as:
- Booking cancellation trends
- Monthly average daily rate (ADR)
- Most common customer types
- Lead time and its effect on cancellations
- Country-wise booking distributions

---

##  Tools Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Google Colab**

##  Key Visualizations:
- Bar chart of cancellations by month
- Line plot of ADR (Average Daily Rate) over time
- Pie chart of guest types
- Histogram of lead time
- Country-wise bookings map (if done)
